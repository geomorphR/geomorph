\title{Comparisons of Effect Sizes from Partial Least Squares}
\usage{
\method{compare}{pls}(..., two.tailed = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{saved analyses of class pls}

\item{two.tailed}{A logical value to indicate whether a two-tailed test (typical and default) should be performed.}
}
\value{
An object of class compare.pls, returns a list of the following
\item{sample.z}{A vector of effect sizes for each sample.}
\item{sample.r.sd}{A vector of standard deviations for each sampling distribution (following Box-Cox transformation).}
\item{pairwise.z}{A matrix of pairwise, two-sample z scores between all pairs of effect sizes.}
\item{pairwise.p}{A matrix of corresponding P-values.}
}
\description{
Function performs an analysis to compare the effect sizes of two or more PLS effects
}
\details{
The function statistically compares the effect sizes of two or more PLS analyses.  Typically, this
function might be used to compare levels of integration between two or more samples, each measuring morphological 
integration between different modules.  In such cases, the PLS correlation coefficient, r, is not a good
measure of integration effect, as its expected value is dependent on both the number of specimens and number 
of variables (Adams and Collyer 2016).  This analysis calculates effect sizes as standard deviates, z, and 
performs two-sample z-tests, using the pooled standard error from the sampling distributions of the PLS analyses.
 
To use this function, perform \code{\link{two.b.pls}}, \code{\link{integration.test}}, or 
 \code{\link{phylo.integration}} on as many samples as desired.  Any number of objects of class pls can be input.
 
 Similar versions of this function will be designed for alternative test statistics, in the future. 

 \subsection{Notes for geomorph 3.0.4 and subsequent versions}{ 
 Compared to previous versions of geomorph, users might notice differences in effect sizes.  Previous versions used z-scores calculated with 
 expected values of statistics from null hypotheses (sensu Collyer et al. 2015); however Adams and Collyer (2016) showed that expected values 
 for some statistics can vary with sample size and variable number, and recommended finding the expected value, empirically, as the mean from the set 
 of random outcomes.  Geomorph 3.0.4 and subsequent versions now center z-scores on their empirically estimated expected values and where appropriate, 
 log-transform values to assure statistics are normally distributed.  This can result in negative effect sizes, when statistics are smaller than 
 expected compared to the average random outcome.  For ANOVA-based functions, the option to choose among different statistics to measure effect size 
 is now a function argument.
