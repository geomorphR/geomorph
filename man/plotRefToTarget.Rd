\description{
Function plots shape differences between a reference and target specimen
}
\details{
The function generates a plot of the shape differences of a target specimen relative to a reference 
 specimen. The option "mag" allows the user to indicates the degree of magnification to be used when 
 displaying the shape difference. The function will plot either two- or three-dimensional data. 
 
 For two-dimensional data and thin-plate spline deformation plots, the user may also supply boundary 
 curves of the object, which will be deformed from the reference to the target specimen using the 
 thin-plate spline. Such curves are often useful in describing 
 the biological shape differences expressed in the landmark coordinates.  Note that to utilize this option, 
 a boundary curve from a representative specimen must first be warped to the reference specimen using
  \code{\link{warpRefOutline}}.
  
 Additionally, if a matrix of links is provided, the landmarks will be connected by lines.  
 The link matrix is an M x 2 matrix, where M is the desired number of links. Each row of the link matrix 
 designates the two landmarks to be connected by that link.
  
 Four distinct methods for plots are available:
 \enumerate{
 \item {TPS} a thin-plate spline deformation grid is generated. For 3D data, 
 this method will generate thin-plate spline deformations in the x-y and x-z planes. 
 \item {vector}: a plot showing the vector displacements between corresponding landmarks in the reference 
 and target specimen is shown. 
 \item {points} a plot is displayed with the landmarks in the target overlaying 
 those of the reference.  
 \item {surface} a mesh3d surface is warped using thin-plate spline (for 3D data only). 
 Requires mesh3d object in option "mesh", made using \code{\link{warpRefMesh}}. 
 }
 This function combines numerous plotting functions found in Claude (2008).
