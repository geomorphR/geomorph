\usage{
plotspec(
  spec,
  digitspec,
  fixed = NULL,
  fixed.pt.col = "red",
  fixed.pt.size = 10,
  mesh.ptsize = 1,
  centered = FALSE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{spec}{An object of class shape3d/mesh3d, or matrix of 3D vertex coordinates.}

\item{digitspec}{Name of data matrix containing 3D fixed and/or surface sliding coordinates.}

\item{fixed}{Numeric The number of fixed template landmarks (listed first in digitspec)}

\item{fixed.pt.col}{The color for plotting fixed template landmarks (if any)}

\item{fixed.pt.size}{The size for plotting fixed template landmarks (if any)}

\item{mesh.ptsize}{Numeric Size to plot the mesh points (vertices), e.g. 0.1 for dense meshes, 3 for sparse meshes}

\item{centered}{Logical Whether the data matrix is in the surface mesh coordinate system (centered = "FALSE") or
if the data were collected after the mesh was centered (centered = "TRUE")- see details.}

\item{...}{additional parameters which will be passed to rgl-plot3d or 
rgl-points3d.}

\description{
A function to plot three-dimensional (3D) specimen along with its landmarks.
}
\details{
Function to plot 3D specimens along with their digitized "fixed" landmarks and semilandmarks
"surface sliders" and "curve sliders". If specimen is a 3D surface (class shape3d/mesh3d) mesh is plotted.
For visualization purposes, 3D coordinate data collected using \code{\link{digit.fixed}} or 
\code{\link{digitsurface}} and \code{\link{buildtemplate}} prior to build 1.1-6 were centered by default. 
Therefore use this function with centered = "TRUE". Data collected outside geomorph should be read using
centered = "FALSE". The function assumes the fixed landmarks are listed at the beginning of
the coordinate matrix (digitspec).

This function is a wrapper for several functions in the \code{rgl} package.  
Although there is some allowance for arguments to be passed to \code{rgl} functions,
some override of rgl-plot3d arguments is required.  Errors that result from trying
to pass rgl-plot3d or rgl-points3d arguments should inspire the user
to find solutions with \code{rgl} core functions.
