\title{Principal and phylogenetically-aligned components analysis of shape data}
\usage{
gm.prcomp(
  A,
  phy = NULL,
  align.to.phy = FALSE,
  GLS = FALSE,
  transform = FALSE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{A}{A 3D array (p x k x n) containing Procrustes shape variables for a set of aligned specimens.
Alternatively, this can be an n x p matrix of any data, but output will not contain information about shapes.}

\item{phy}{An optional phylogenetic tree of class phylo}

\item{align.to.phy}{An optional argument for whether \bold{PaCA} (if TRUE) should be performed}

\item{GLS}{Whether GLS-centering and covariance estimation should be used (rather than OLS).}

\item{transform}{A logical value to indicate if transformed residuals should be projected.  This is only applicable if 
GLS = TRUE.  If TRUE, an orthogonal projection of transformed data is made; if FALSE an oblique projection of untransformed 
data is made.}

\item{...}{Other arguments passed to \code{\link[RRPP]{ordinate}} and \code{\link{scale}}.  The most common
arguments are scale., tol, and rank.}
}
\value{
An object of class "gm.prcomp" contains a list of results for each of the PCA approaches implemented.
Each of these lists includes the following components:
\item{x}{Component scores for all specimens.}
\item{anc.x}{Component scores for the ancestors on the phylogeny.}
\item{d}{The singular values of the decomposed VCV matrix.}
\item{rotation}{The matrix of variable loadings, i.e. the eigenvectors of the decomposed matrix.}
\item{shapes}{A list with the shape coordinates of the extreme ends of all PC axes.}
\item{ancestors}{The matrix of estimated ancestral shapes, if a phylogeny is used.}
\item{anc.var}{The variances among ancestor scores, by component, if a phylogeny is used.}
}
\description{
Function performs principal components analysis (PCA) or 
phylogenetically-aligned components (PaCA) on Procrustes shape coordinates.
}
\details{
The function performs a series of ordinations, taking into account, phylogeny, if desired.
There are two main types of ordinations: principal components analysis (PCA) and phylogenetically-
aligned components analysis (PaCA).  Both of these have two variants: centering and projection
via ordinary least-squares (OLS) or via generalized least-squares (GLS).  The name,
"gm.prcomp", references that this function performs much like \code{\link{prcomp}}, in terms
of arguments and output, but this function is quite a bit more diverse.  This function has
the capability of performing analyses generally referred to as:

\describe{
\item{\bold{PCA}}{  Standard PCA based on OLS-centering and projection of data.}
\item{\bold{Phylomorphospace}}{  Standard PCA with estimated ancestral 
states and phylogenetic branches projected into ordination plots.}
\item{\bold{phyloPCA}}{  PCA based on GLS-centering and projection of data.  Also possible to 
project ancestral states into plots. Note that if transformed GLS-residuals are used for projection, the ancestral states
might not appear logical, as the projection is independent of phylogeny.  With OLS-centering, a phyloPCA as described by 
Revell (2009) is produced.}
\item{\bold{PaCA}}{  Phylogenetically-aligned component analysis.  Data are aligned to an axis of greatest phylogenetic
signal rather than axis of greatest dispersion.  This analysis can use either OLS- or GLS-centering and projection.  
Phylogenetic signal is strongest in the first few components of the OLS approach.  This analysis will make little sense with 
GLS-centering and projection of transformed residuals, since phylogenetic signal is removed the transformed data.  
See Collyer and Adams (2021) for more details. For greater flexibility for type of residuals and projection of trees, 
use \code{\link[RRPP]{ordinate}}.  See Collyer and Adams (2021) for details.}
}

\describe{
\item{\bold{phy}}{Whether a phylogeny and estimated ancestral states are considered in plots.}
\item{\bold{align.to.phy}}{Whether components are aligned to phylogenetic signal (rather than principal axes).}
\item{\bold{GLS}}{Whether to use GLS-centering and estimation of covariance matrix.}
\item{\bold{transform}}{Whether to transform GLS-residuals (making them independent of phylogeny and an orthogonal
projection from the transformed data space, as opposed to an oblique projection from the untransformed data space).}
}

PLOTTING: Contrary to previous geomorph implementations, gm.prcomp does not produce plots. 
For plotting gm.prcomp class objects combine \code{\link{plot.gm.prcomp}} and 
\code{\link{picknplot.shape}} following the examples below. 

SUMMARY STATISTICS: For principal component plots, the traditional statistics to summarize the analysis include
eigenvalues (variance by component), proportion of variance by component, and cumulative proportion of variance. 
When data are aligned to a phylogenetic covariance matrix, the statistics are less straightforward.  A summary of
of such an analysis (performed with \code{\link{summary.gm.prcomp}}) will produce these additional statistics:

\describe{
\item{\bold{Singular Value}}{  Rather than eigenvalues, the singular values from singular value decomposition of the 
cross-product of the scaled phylogenetic covariance matrix and the data.}
\item{\bold{Proportion of Covariance}}{  Each component's singular value divided by the sum of singular values.  The cumulative
proportion is also returned.  Note that these values do not explain the amount of covariance between phylogeny and data, but
explain the distribution of the covariance.  Large proportions can be misleading.}
\item{\bold{RV by Component}}{  The partial RV statistic by component.  Cumulative values are also returned.  The sum of partial
RVs is Escoffier's RV statistic, which measures the amount of covariation between phylogeny and data.  Caution should
be used in interpreting these values, which can vary with the number of observations and number of variables.  However,
the RV is more reliable than proportion of singular value for interpretation of the strength of linear association for 
phylogenetically-aligned components.}
\item{\bold{Tips or Ancestors Dispersion}}{  The variances of points by component for tip data and estimated ancestral
character states, after projection.  These values will differ from variances from PCA with GLS estimation, as the "Importance
of Components" weights variances by phylogenetic covariances.  Dispersion statistics correspond to the amount of scatter in
plots of component scores.}

NOTE: The \code{\link{plot.gm.prcomp}} function performs the same plotting that was previously 
possible with \code{plotTangentSpace} and \code{plotGMPhyloMorphoSpace}, which
have now been deprecated.
